# Skz Boilerplate
This is project I'm working on, basically it's my own "bootstrap/boilerplate" that I'll use to write websites much faster in a near future.
Feel free to fork it, it uses SASS for theming so it won't be hard to customize the way you want it. The main goal is to have a way to make nice designs within a little time. Without having to make compromise between quality/time given.

>**Note** that this is a WIP project so please bear in mind that it's not finished and many css is missing.
